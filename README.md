Network Support Technician turned Backend Developer. Leveraging my ISP experience to build robust network applications while expanding my toolkit.

I thrive in environments where I can learn new technologies and apply them to solve real-world problems.

Not a unicorn ðŸ¦„ - just a developer who believes in solid foundations, clean code, and constant evolution.
